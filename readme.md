# Machine Learning Training Project

This project demonstrates a machine learning workflow using **scikit-learn**.  
It covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving the trained model for future use.

---

## 📌 Overview

The notebook `training.ipynb` walks through:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- Training a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluating performance with accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix
- Saving the trained model with **pickle**

---

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone Online-Payment-Fraud-Detection
cd OnlinePaymentFraudDetection
```

---

## 🗂️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- pickle (built-in)

## 🚀 Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook training.ipynb
```

2. Run all cells to:

   - Preprocess the dataset
   - Train the machine learning model
   - Evaluate performance
   - Save the trained model

3. The trained model will be saved as a `.pkl` file for reuse.

## 📊 Results

- Accuracy score is calculated
- Classification report and confusion matrix are generated
- Visualizations of the dataset and model performance are provided

---

## 🔮 Future Work

- Try other machine learning algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM)
- Perform hyperparameter tuning for better results
- Deploy the trained model as an API or web application
